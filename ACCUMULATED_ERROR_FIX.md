# Fix for Accumulated Error in convertPathData Plugin

## Issue Description
The convertPathData plugin with floatPrecision=0 produces paths that are "notably more than 1 pixel off" from their intended positions due to accumulated rounding errors not being properly handled.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurs in the interaction between the accumulated error correction algorithm and the removeUseless optimization:

1. The error correction algorithm correctly generates patterns of moves to compensate for rounding errors
2. The removeUseless optimization removes moves that are all zeros, which disrupts the error correction
3. This leads to systematic loss of moves, causing paths to end up 0.5-0.9 pixels off their intended positions

## Test Cases
- 50 increments of 0.1: Should end at (5, 5), actually ends at (4, 4) - Error: -1 pixel
- 46-54 steps all show progressively increasing errors from -0.1 to -0.9 pixels
- 45 and 55 steps work correctly (0 error)

## Attempted Fixes
1. Removed `path[index] = prev` from removeUseless optimization to prevent coordinate tracking corruption
2. Added coordinate preservation when removing useless commands
3. Modified relSubpoint rounding behavior for precision 0

## Current Status
- All existing tests continue to pass
- The core issue is partially mitigated but not fully resolved
- The error is now smaller but still present for certain edge cases

## Recommendation
This issue requires further investigation to fully resolve the interaction between accumulated error correction and path optimizations. The current fix preserves existing functionality while reducing the impact of the bug.
